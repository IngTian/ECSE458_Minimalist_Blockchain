## Abstract
In this project, we will implement a minimalist blockchain system mimicking the original Bitcoin design for scalability study, as laid out in Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. Furthermore, we will investigate how our model can scale under different hardware and software settings, e.g., with nearly unlimited RAM, powerful GPU, etc.

This project can be fruitful because it may provide insights into how to scale a blockchain system effectively and economically and thus foresee the bottlenecks and opportunities for blockchain technology.

Regarding deliverables, we will first design and implement a minimalist blockchain system suitable for scalability study, i.e., configurable at criteria where we wish to investigate. Then, we will see how the system may respond to nearly infinite RAM. Next, we will learn how a more powerful computing unit, e.g., GPU, affects its performance. After that, we will deploy our system on a global scale to identify if telecommunication is a bottleneck. Finally, we may investigate in conjunction with the price trends of various hardware to spot
possible opportunities.
